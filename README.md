- The client sends a GET request every second to the server and updates it's page.

#### Client Request
##### HTTP
```
GET 127.0.0.1:17069/http
```
##### WebSocket
```
GET 127.0.0.1:17069/ws
```

### Note
- This project is currently in a beta state. 
- It would be possible for matching techniques to produce duplicated, unaccounted-for, and false postitive matches.
- Winner/Loser confidence is successful ~99% of the time.
- Score tracking is ~90% accurate, certain game mechanics (like rotom scoring points) are extremely difficult to process.
- Users are encouraged to report issues, or contribute where they can to help polish a final product.

# Testing
- - Head into PokÃ©mon UNITE's Practice Mode and verify UniteHUD is capturing time/orbs/enemy score/self score.
- - Use the "Configure" button to verify the selection areas.
